# Learning Framework Distinctions

|:----|:----|
**Direction** - Establishing direction involves setting clear intentions for a specific to achievement, paying attention to thoughts, feelings, and surroundings, aligning behavior with intentions, and developing the skills necessary to bring a vision to reality<p><p>Intention refers to a conscious choice or plan to pursue a specific goal. Attention involves focusing on what truly matters and being present in each moment.  Behaviour refers to the actions taken in support of an intentions, and skills are the abilities develop to achieve goals more effectively. <p><p>By combining these four elements, clarity is gained in a direction which enables meaningful action towards growth and achievement.|![Learnng Framework](/Library/Images/Directional-model.svg)
![Learnng Framework](/Library/Images/Operational-model.svg)|**Operational** - Operationalising involves the development of a range of skills that help to effectively turn aspirations into tangible results. Organisational skills enables effective planning, prioritisation and execution of tasks in a structured manner. Managerial skills help to effectively manage time, resources, and finances to achieve outcomes. Interpersonal skills enables effective communication and collaborate with others, build strong relationships, and resolve conflicts. Personal skills, such as self-awareness, self-discipline, and resilience, enables the ability to overcome obstacles, stay motivated, and grow as a person.
**Production** - Creating goals involves defining specific, realistic, and timed aspirations that align with individual values and priorities. When setting goals, it's important to focus on the positive outcomes to be achieved, and make sure goals are measurable so it is known when they are achieved. Antecedence are the limitations and obstacles faced, they should be considered when creating goals by recognising and developing strategies to overcome challenges help increase the chances for success. Finally, defining the reward that is received as a result of achieving goals can be a powerful motivator. This reward can be seen, felt, heard, known, or had, and should align with individual values. |![Learnng Framework](/Library/Images/SOAR-model.svg)
![Learnng Framework](/Library/Images/Logical-levels-of-learning.svg)|The **Logical Levels of Learning** and conscious competence refer to the four stages of skill development and awareness that an individual goes through as they learn and grow.<p><p>Level 0 is characterised by a reflex or automatic response, where the individual does not know that they don't know about a particular skill or knowledge.<p><p>Level 1 involves an applied response to a situation, where the individual becomes aware of their lack of knowledge and begins to explore what they don't know.<p><p>Level 2 is a patterned behavior, where the individual gains a deeper understanding of how to do something and starts to apply this knowledge consistently.<p><p>Level 3 represents a paradigmatic response, where the individual has a deep understanding of why they do what they do and can act with confidence and ease.<p><p>This framework helps individuals to understand their current level of competence and supports a roadmap for continued growth and development.|

# Open Learning Model
## Introductoin
This course is designed to provide the tools, resources and skills to undertake self lead learning and produce outcomes in relevant areas. The course has been designed to provide students with high level, yet comprehensive study areas that are both open and flexible. You should expect to acquire the relevant knowledge and skill to apply these learnings in a practical and real way.

## Learning Framework
The following framework is a guide to explore, research and learn about a subject area. It is designed to support an open and self lead learning style. It can be used as generative prompts to support internet searches or research areas, study strategies or implementation plans. When applied they create a well rounded understanding of the subject area being explored or applied.

These framework questions are designed to be flexible and adaptable with the ability to modify and contextualise to the specific area of study. Questions are broken into four distinct areas, each with four distinct question types. The order of the questions or the specific phrasing is not important, though you will need to make them relevant to the study area.

It is important that you spend time establishing your question sets for a given study area. 

* _“Ask a better question, get a better answer.”_

* _“A problem well stated is a problem half solved”_

## Question / Integration areas and types
||||||
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----
| **Directional** |||
|| Intention | Attention | Skill | Behaviour
**Operational** ||
|| Organisational|Managerial|Interpersonal|Personal
| **Learning** |
|| Why | How | Does | Happens
| **Production** |
|| Specific |Outcome | Antecedence | Reward

## Attention
It is important to be flexible with how these questions are framed and used. They can be mixed together to form more complex questions or statements, often being more Outcome focused when a Specific Intention is applied.
