# Learning Framework
This learning framework provides a structured and intentional approach to learning and teaching. It brings together the key elements of learning goals, content design, subject matter experts, and measurable competencies. This approach helps individuals to focus their efforts, make meaningful progress, and achieve their learning outcomes.

The use of this learning framework has several key benefits, including increased student engagement and motivation, targeted and relevant instruction, and effective assessment and feedback. By providing a clear and actionable approach to learning, the learning framework helps individuals to make the most of their time and resources, and achieve their goals more efficiently and effectively.


# Key Learning Distinctions

|||
|:----|:----|
**Direction** - Getting personal direction involves setting clear intentions for what you want to achieve in life, paying attention to your thoughts, feelings, and surroundings, aligning your behavior with your intentions, and developing the skills necessary to bring your vision to reality<p><p>Intention refers to a conscious choice or plan to pursue a specific goal. Attention involves focusing on what truly matters to you and being present in each moment.  Behaviour refers to the actions you take in support of your intentions, and skills are the abilities you develop to achieve your goals more effectively. <p><p>By combining these four elements, clarity is gained in ones direction which enables meaningful action towards personal growth and fulfillment.|![Learnng Framework](/Library/Images/Directional-model.svg)
![Learnng Framework](/Library/Images/Operational-model.svg)|**Operational** - Operationalising involves the development of a range of skills that help to effectively turn aspirations into tangible results. Organisational skills enables effective planning, prioritisation and execution of tasks in a structured manner. Managerial skills helps to effectively manage time, resources, and finances to achieve goals. Interpersonal skills enables effective communication and collaborate with others, build strong relationships, and resolve conflicts. Personal skills, such as self-awareness, self-discipline, and resilience, enables the ability to overcome obstacles, stay motivated, and grow as a person.
**Production** - Creating goals involves defining specific, realistic, and timed aspirations that align with individual values and priorities. When setting goals, it's important to focus on the positive outcomes to be achieved, and make sure  goals are measurable so it is known when they're achieved. Antecedence are the limitations and obstacles faced, they should be considered when creating goals, recognising and developing strategies to overcome these challenges help increase the chances for success. Finally, defining the reward that is received as a result of achieving goals can be a powerful motivator. This reward can be seen, felt, heard, known, or had, and should align with individual values. |![Learnng Framework](/Library/Images/SOAR-model.svg)
![Learnng Framework](/Library/Images/Logical-levels-of-learning.svg)|The logical levels of learning and conscious competence refer to the four stages of skill development and awareness that an individual goes through as they learn and grow.<p><p>Level 0 is characterised by a reflex or automatic response, where the individual does not know that they don't know about a particular skill or knowledge.<p><p>Level 1 involves an applied response to a situation, where the individual becomes aware of their lack of knowledge and begins to explore what they don't know.<p><p>Level 2 is a patterned behavior, where the individual gains a deeper understanding of how to do something and starts to apply this knowledge consistently.<p><p>Level 3 represents a paradigmatic response, where the individual has a deep understanding of why they do what they do and can act with confidence and ease.<p><p>This framework helps individuals to understand their current level of competence and supports a roadmap for continued growth and development. 

# Integrating the Distinctions

Directional, operational, goals, and learning are four main themes that are integral to personal and professional development. Having a clear direction provides focus and purpose, while operationalising goals involves developing the skills necessary to turn aspirations into tangible results. Setting well-defined goals helps to break down complex challenges into manageable tasks and provides a roadmap for progress. <p><p>Learning is a critical component of this process, as it enables individuals to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve their goals and continue to grow and evolve.<p><p>By bringing these four themes together, individuals can create a holistic approach to personal and professional development that integrates personal growth with practical action and a commitment to continuous learning.|![Learnng Framework](/Library/Images/Integrated-Distinctions.svg)
![Learnng Framework](/Library/Images/Framework-inputs.svg)|These distinctions come together to form a comprehensive learning framework by linking learning goals, subjects, experts, and competencies. <p><p>The learning framework starts with the identification of clear and specific learning goals, which then inform the subjects and areas of knowledge that need to be studied.<p><p>Individuals can then seek out experts in these subjects to gain deeper understanding and insights. The competencies developed through this process can then be assessed and evaluated to ensure that individuals are meeting their learning goals and making progress.<p><p>By integrating these elements in a structured and intentional manner, the learning framework provides a roadmap for individuals to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve their learning goals. |
This comprehensive learning framework supports session plans, teaching, and student resources by providing a structured and intentional approach to learning. The learning goals and competencies identified in the framework inform the content and focus of each session, ensuring that students receive targeted and relevant instruction. Teaching resources and materials can be selected and tailored to support student learning and help students to connect the learning goals and competencies to real-world scenarios.<p><p>Assessment tasks are integrated by design to measure student progress towards the learning goals and competencies, providing valuable feedback on areas of strength and areas for improvement. This feedback can be used to inform future learning activities and support continuous improvement.<p><p>By bringing these elements together, the learning framework supports a holistic and integrated approach that focuses on the individual needs and goals of each student. <p><p>This approach leads to increased student engagement, motivation, and satisfaction, and helps individuals to make meaningful progress towards their learning goals.|![Learnng Framework](/Library/Images/Learning-Framework.svg)
