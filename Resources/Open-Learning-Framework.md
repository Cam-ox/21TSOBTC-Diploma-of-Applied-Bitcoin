# Open Learning Model
## Introductoin
This course is designed to provide you with the tools, resources and skills to undertake self lead learning and produce outcomes in relevant areas. The course has been designed to provide students with high level, yet comprehensive study areas that are both open and flexible. You should expect to acquire the relevant knowledge and skill to apply these learnings in a practical and real way.

## Self Lead Learning Framework
The following framework is a guide to explore, research and learn about a subject area. It is designed to support an open and self lead learning style. It can be used as generative prompts to support internet searches or research areas, study strategies or implementation plans. When applied they create a well rounded understanding of the subject area being explored or applied.

These framework questions are designed to be flexible and adaptable with the ability to modify and contextualise to the specific area of study. Questions are broken into four distinct areas, each with four distinct question types. The order of the questions or the specific phrasing is not important, though you will need to make them relevant to the study area.

It is important that you spend time establishing your question sets for a given study area. 

* _“Ask a better question, get a better answer.”_

* _“A problem well stated is a problem half solved”_

## Attention
It is important to be flexible with how these questions are framed and used. They can be mixed together to form more complex questions or statements, often being more Outcome focused when a Specific Intention is applied.
