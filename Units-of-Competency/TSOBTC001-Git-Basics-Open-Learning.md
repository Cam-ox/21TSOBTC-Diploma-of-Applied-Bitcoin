## Elements and Performance Criteria
Elements | Performance Critera
| :--- | :---
Elements describe the essential outcomes  | Performance criteria describe the performance needed to demonstrate achievement of the element.
Utilising git as a distributed version control system that tracks changes in sets of computer files  |Create a repo - to put a project up on git, you will need to create a repository for it to live in.<p> Fork a repo - A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “upstream” repository.<p> Contributing to projects - Learn how to contribute to a project through forking.<p>Communicating on git - You can discuss specific projects and changes, as well as broader ideas or team goals, using different types of discussions on git.<p> Work with markdown scripting language to create documents and discuss ideas.<p>Organise and post markdown documents in your repository.
Identify Learning Goals and Objectives |Utilise Open Learning Framework.<p><p>Complete a learning plan.<p>Post learning plan in Git respository.<p>Communicate learning plan.
Investigate decentralised networks| Utilise Q&A framework to explore decentralised networks in today's society.


## Foundaton Skills
*This section describes those language, literacy, numeracy and employment skills that are essential to performance but not explicit in the erformance criteria.*

Skill  | Description
| :--- | :---
Learning |Monitors outcomes of decisions, considering results and identifying key concepts and principles that may be adaptable in the future
Numeracy |Uses mathematical formulae to calculate required equipment, undertake measurements and determine response times
Reading |Recognises and interprets technical, manufacturer and organisational documentation to determine and confirm job requirements
Writing | Prepares documentation outlining maintenance schedule according to specified requirements
Planning and organising |Operates from a broad conceptual plan, developing the operational detail in stages, regularly reviewing priorities and performance during implementation, and identifying and addressing issues
Problem solving |Uses nuanced understanding of context to recognise anomalies and subtle deviations to normal expectations, focusing attention and remedying problems as they arise
Self Management | Takes full responsibility for identifying and considering relevant organisational protocols and requirements<br><br>Uses systematic processes, setting goals, gathering required information and identifying and evaluating options against agreed criteria
Technology |Demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of principles, concepts, language and practices associated with the digital world
